      As an average person even myself don't know what my skills are. But let me try my best to think and tell you what skills i have. Well many people are telling me that i have skills in socializing, Because everybody is my friend. In some reasons i agree that i really have the skill in socializing. Some of my friends treat me as a clown of the group. That's why i can say that i have skill in making other people laugh. I' m also a sport lover guy. I play basketball and won an <abbr title="Most Valuable Player">MVP</abbr> during my childhood. I also play table tennis and won some competition. Leadership is also a skill that i can say i have. During my Junior HighSchool days i belong to the <abbr title="Student Government Organization">SGO.</abbr>  Being the President of SGO enhanced my other skills not only leadership. It enhanced my communication skill. It also enhanced my patience and many more. Writing this made me realize that i have many skills. <>17</> I feel proud of myself because i have those skills that i mention. In college i learned new skill that i really love. <>19</>I will work hard to improve this skill. That skill is programming because many of my friends is saying that i have skill in programming.

      I'm the type of person that likes to try everything. If i'm curious of one thing i will try that,  That's why i have many hobbies. Let me start with playing sports. I enjoy playing different kinds of sports. Like basketball, table tennis, volleyball etc. I consider hanging out with my friends as an hobby. Hanging out with my friends relieve the stress or sadness that i have. I always find some time to hang out with my friends because i feel like my week will feel empty if i dont. As a part of generation Z i have hobbies that is typical for gen z's like me. I love browsing the internet. Like i spent half of my day checking the social media. Spending too much time in social media is the hobby that i like to change because i feel like social media is not a real world. I notice that i waste too much time in social media. Instead of using social media i like to use my time in more valuable things. When pandemic happen i discover some things that makes me happy, those things are making me happy until now, and that is watching KDramas and listening to KPop. I consider KDramas and KPop as my happy pill and hobby.

    <blockquote><p>
      On every chapter in my life i always change my interest. So i will tell you those interest that i had and i have. I can say that during my childhood i'm very interested in playing sports. My number one dream that time is to be a Pro basketball player but living in the philippines the competition is so hard because everybody loves playing basketball. That's why i lost interest in basketball. During my teenage years i became interested in aviation because my dream that time is to be a pilot. I'm very vocal about that dream and interest to my family and friends. To be a pilot you need a lot of money to study aviation. Our family is just average. So sending me to aviation school is too impossible. So during the enrollment of college out of nowhere i just chose to study <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>. At first i feel that i don't belong here and wanting to shift but after a year of studying this course. I found my new interest and that is programming. I cant believe that i will be interested in programming because just hearing that word many student will be scared. My interest in programming is growing until now. I always do my research to learn something new and expand my knowledge. Those are the things that interest me starting from childhood up to now.
