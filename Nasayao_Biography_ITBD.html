This story started on June 18, 2000 in Tondo, Manila where the world heard my first cry. <sup>1</sup> I'm the youngest in our family and i have two older sisters, <sup>2</sup> my father was a seaman back then, <sup>3</sup> and my mother is the one who took care of me and my sisters when we were young. <sup>4</sup> I grew up in small city of Cainta in the province of Rizal. <sup>5</sup> I am just a typical child that makes my mom's head hurt because of my craziness. <sup>6</sup> During my Childhood the hospitals is like an hotel to me because of my weak immune system, <sup>7</sup> i survived many diseases and sickneness on my childhood days. <sup>8</sup> As a filipino child that grew up in a family and a country that really love the sport of basketball, <sup>9</sup> i fell in love with the sport too, <sup>10</sup> i became an MVP in my school and also won many awards in our village. <sup>11</sup> Childhood is the memory that we will never forget because during those times life is much easier, <sup>12</sup> we know how to be contented, <sup>13</sup> and simple things like playing and hanging out with our friends or family can make us truly happy, <sup>14</sup> and we dont have many problems back then. <sup>15</sup> If you'll ask me  what chapter in my life i really want to go back i will proudly say "My childhood". <sup>16</sup> I know not everyone will agree but for me childhood is the best part of my life. <sup>17</sup> Those were days that are problems are not that big. <sup>18</sup> The days that we only got hurt physically because of our clumsiness and not emotionally because someone hurt us.<sup>19</sup> I hope children today can realize that being a child is the best moment in your life. <sup>20</sup>

For me this chapter of my life was the most enjoyable but also the most confusing stage of my existence.<sup>1</sup> Those were the days that i dont know if i'm still young or already an adult.<sup>2</sup> Teenage years was the time where i made some worst decision in my life.<sup>3</sup> For me my teenage years is the experimental phase of my life,<sup>4</sup> because i'm very curious of many things and try to explore the life more.<sup>5</sup> Being teenager is like you're looking for something but you don't know what it is.<sup>6</sup> This is when you first experience being in love and also being heartbroken.<sup>7</sup> My teenage years was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions.<sup>8</sup> My teenage years is full of first time.<sup>9</sup> Those years are also the part of many realization,<sup>10</sup> you are more open to what really is the real world.<sup>11</sup> But the best that the teenage years gave to me is the people that i met with those years.<sup>12</sup> The friendship that i had during those years,<sup>13</sup> and the the friendship that stays until now.<sup>14</sup> The memories with the people that i met during my teenage years is incomparable.<sup>15</sup> To those person that i met i hope that all of you are doing fine,<sup>16</sup> let me say this that the memories and the bond that we all had are one of the reasons why sometimes i randomly smile out of nowhere just thinking of the friendships we all had,<sup>17</sup> and to those that i'm still friends with at this moment of my life,<sup>18</sup> you all are big impact to my life,<sup>19</sup> and you all are one of my source of happiness.<sup>20</sup> No words can explain how thankful i am that the friendship that formed during my teenage years is staying strong until now.<sup>21</sup>
